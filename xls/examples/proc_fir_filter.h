// Defines a finite impulse response (FIR) filter as a proc.
// FIR filters are commonly used for Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
// applications as they implement a convolution.
// There are many use cases of FIR filters as the concept of convolution is very
// general. For example, a convolution in time domain is equivalent
// to multiplication in the Fourier domain, so a frequent use of an FIR filter
// is to implement a low or high pass filter. A Sobel edge detector in computer
// graphics is an FIR filter. In the wireless world, FIR filters can be used to
// model and therefore mitigate channel effects, which is an important step in
// decoding a received signal in certain cases.
