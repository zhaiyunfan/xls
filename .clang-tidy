# clang-diagnostic-builtin-macro-redefined : Don't complain about bazel
#    defining __TIMESTAMP__ and __DATE__ for hermeticity.
#
# readability-make-member-function-const is great, but it also suggests that
#    in cases where we return a non-const pointer. So good to check, not by
#    default.
#
# readability-qualified-auto is useful in general, however it suggests
#    to convert iterators (e.g. std::string_view::begin()) to the pointer it
#    returns; however since the iterator is implementation defined, this is not
#    a valid assertion. Running the check every now and then manually and
#    fixing all the non-iterator cases is useful though. Off by default.
#
# readability-use-anyofallof is overly aggressive, suggesting conversion of for
#    loops into std::any_of/all_of in cases where it makes the code less
#    readable.
#
# misc-const-correctness: useful, but it seems to be overzealous at times,
#    arriving at incorrect conclusions.
#
# modernize-make-unique: mostly correct, but wants to also replace .reset()
#    which is a more readable way than assign.
#
# modernize-loop-convert: Improper use of auto for loop variable.
#
# misc-use-anonymous-namespace: Using static on non-member functions has the
#    essentially the same effect as putting them in an anonymous namespace and
#    has added benefits -- including, having the statement of internal linkage
#    right by the function definition.
